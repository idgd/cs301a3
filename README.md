# cs301a3

Implement six similar ordered collection data types.

# linked list

* test
* bugfix

# doubly linked list

* test
* bugfix

# q: is internal list linked list?
From my testing in CS301a2, doesn't look like it. The list appends and pops differently based on position, something a linked list would never do. For example, appending is much faster than removing or adding an item in the middle of the list, while LL would be constant time regardless of position.

# stack

* test
* bugfix

# queue

* test
* bugfix

# deque

* test
* bugfix

# peverse polish notation

* done!
